## personal `drat` repository for my R packages

This repository holds R packages for downloading from R. Presently, any package found here is under development, not yet ready for use, and probably not available for Windows users.

## basic usage

To install an R package found in this repository, use `install.packages` as usual but set the repository to "https://connordonegan.github.io/drat", as in:

```
install.packages("geostan", repo = "https://connordonegan.github.io/drat")
```
